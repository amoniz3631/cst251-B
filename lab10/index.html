		<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
		<p>The only challenges I faced was trying to decide what I wanted my page to look like.</p>

		<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>We didn't run into any problems with this lab. Due to our experience with
		previous labs we feel confident with these concepts.</p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>This lab resulted in an uploaded lab9 page styled with well-organized CSS
		and Google fonts. We also were able to update our homepage with a better font
		selection.</p>
