					<li>What elements help to present a clear and interesting web page?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>The left 'block' navbar looks neat and could easily be standardized
							to match other group members' pages</li>
							<li>The portrait and biography together at the top help solidify the
							topic and seeing George's face makes his poetry feel more personal</li>
							<li>Putting the poetry next to the commentary and under the portrait
							& bio breaks up the clutter and allows for better comparison</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What would you add to the design and why?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>More images of Carmel, SF, and George along with other audio and
							visual additions would help define George's voice and connect him to the reader</li>
							<li>Tabs for each poem or piece of major information placed at the
							top of the page could reduce clutter and clarify the page's sections</li>
							<li>Slideshows/dropdowns for photos and text could also clean up
							the page</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What would you change or remove from the design and why?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Most sketches have too much going on, some elements could be
							organized (like with tabs), but some such as the multiple asides
							can be consolidated</li>
							<li>The text elements like poems, bio, and commentary should include
							images to liven up the page, and be connected to their relevant elements</li>
							<li>The nav bar and footer should have a format and layout that can
							be used by all group members</li>
						</ul>

				<h2 class="pt-3 border-bottom">Challenge</h2>
				<p class="p-3">This lab actually ended up being less challenging for me
				than lab 20, I could put more detail and time into my sketches while still
				remembering that they didn't have to be perfect. What was difficult was
				incorporating my class and teammates feedback such as reducing clutter and
				the addition of certain elements.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="col-md-4 border border-dark">
				<h2 class="pt-3 border-bottom">Problems</h2>
				<p class="p-3">I didn't run into any problems doing this lab, I made the
				webpage using bootstrap and other things that we've learned and made my
				sketches following the previous and new guidelines and examples. If anything
				was a problem I'd say it was having too many ideas!</p>
			</section>
			<section class="col-md-4 border border-dark">
				<h2 class="pt-3 border-bottom">Results</h2>
				<p class="p-3">On completion of this lab I now have three great sketches
				that I can share with my team and use as a basis for building my webpage
				and to inform some of the unified elements such as the nav bar on all our
				team member's pages. This lab has gotten me excited to make my page and
				the past few labs have introduced and given me needed practice using several
				helpful tools for brainstorming and prototyping.</p>
