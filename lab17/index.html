			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Figuring out how to layout the elements as envisioned in our sketches
			was quite challenging. Float seemed like it would be the easiest since we
			have used it before, but it was actually the most challenging because of
			elements overlapping.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>It was very difficult to make the main 'sections' behave responsively as
			planned using float and flexbox. The elements would not shrink to the desired
		 	size before moving down, and using grid was easiest but the elements would
			not move down at all. With more practice I'm sure these are problems we could
			solve.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Lab17 resulted in four pages laid out with one using no styling, and the
			other three styled with float, flexbox, and grid. We learned how to sketch
			a planned layout and implement it using the aforementioned tools, and we
			also learned why these tools are important for responsive design.</p>
