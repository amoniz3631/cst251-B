				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Figuring out how to use both flexbox and media queries together was a
				real challenge. Initially, we tried using multiple flexboxes to	achieve
				the desired layout, but because they were separate the elements could not
				reorder as desired. After changing the HTML and CSS to make it work with
				one flexbox, more media queries were required to stop our elements from
				inappropriately wrapping. Inspector was very helpful for quickly seeing
				what needed to be changed to allow the page to be responsive.</p>

			<section class="problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>We could not figure out how to get the rows, formed with flex-wrap, to
				all be the same size. Using definite units made it non-responsive and responsive
				units made them misalign as the screen size changed. The solution that kind
				of worked was setting a media query for if the screen size was larger than
				the break point, and changing the 600px media query rule to 750px.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>This lab resulted in a lab18 page styled with flexbox and media queries
				that allow the content to flow responsively and stay aesthetically pleasing
				no matter the screen size. We learned how to use flexboxes more efficiently
				and how to use media queries to make our pages more responsive and professional
				looking.</p>
