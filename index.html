		<p>“Being vulnerable is not about fear, grief, or disappointment, it’s the birthplace
			of everything we are hungry for.” I believe the things the human heart is hungry for
			are basic needs: love, belonging, joy, empathy. Allowing yourself to feel this way in
			front of others will open your mind for understanding and your heart for comfort. I’m
			going to share a little bit about myself with you today in hopes that you would share
			your own vulnerabilities with me. I spend a lot of my freetime drawing and writing.
			These pastimes are easy for me, mostly because I love the distraction. I have an
			extremely hard time being alone, so when I can sit down with a pencil and paper and get
			my thoughts or ideas down it makes me feel a little less disconnected. As if my ideas
			are on paper that someone validates them.</p>
