			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab's main challenge was trying to get the little page to work. It felt as if I couldn't get it to work no matter what I tried.</p>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>During this lab the worst problem was I accidentally started in the wrong
      labâ€™s folder and when switching, Atom got confused and overwrote all my CSS.
      I hadn't backed up to GitHub yet and spent quite a while trying to recover
      the file before a forum suggested trying command Z which, to my surprise, worked.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>On completion of this lab, we now have copycat websites that look and
      respond like their original sites. We also learned more techniques for text
      such as using programs like FontSquirrel, and better understand how to use
      relative and absolute positioning to help us place different elements. </p>
