			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>This lab's main challenge was finding good replacement fonts and images
      for what the original website used. FontSquirrel was unable to read the text
      and Google Fonts didn't have the best options, the final chosen font doesn't
      match exactly but it is close. It was also quite difficult to get the elements
      positioned like in the original site but the inspect tool was quite helpful
      for seeing more immediate changes.</p>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>During this lab the worst problem was I accidentally started in the wrong
      labâ€™s folder and when switching, Atom got confused and overwrote all my CSS.
      I hadn't backed up to GitHub yet and spent quite a while trying to recover
      the file before a forum suggested trying command Z which, to my surprise, worked.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>On completion of this lab, we now have copycat websites that look and
      respond like their original sites. We also learned more techniques for text
      such as using programs like FontSquirrel, and better understand how to use
      relative and absolute positioning to help us place different elements. </p>
