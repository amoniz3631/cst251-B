			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>The challenging part of this lab was creating the transparent text,
      blend modes only worked with black or white backgrounds but this site used
      a color slightly lighter than black which made the rainbow visible behind
      the entire page. Fortunately css-tricks.com had an article with several
      methods and using -webkit-background-clip: text with -webkit-text-fill-color:
      transparent worked perfectly.</p>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>In doing this lab we encountered several problems with positioning items
      so that they would not go out of place as the page was resized, fortunately,
      by implementing what we learned in class about using relative and absolute
      positioning together, the elements finally behaved as desired.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>The completed lab resulted in functioning copycat websites (much) more
      complicated than what we chose for lab13 with several additional text and
      visual elements, as well as lab14 pages showcasing our responsive designs.
      We also now know how to use positioning, display, and background properties
      more effectively than before.</p>
