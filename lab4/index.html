	<h1>Lab 4 - File Transfer </h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>

	<p> The goal of this lab is to upload files to the Github
	server and make them accessable outside of our personal
	repositories. We also learned to test our files before
	pushing them to our official site/</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>

	<p1>I think this lab went fairly smooth. I helped Ben commit
	his changes to his site on Github. </p1>
