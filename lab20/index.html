<h1 class="header">Lab 16: Fancy CSS 2</h1>

<div id="sections">
			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>The animation and transform properties were a bit challenging to understand
			at first because of the different properties needed for the div and the keyframes
			selectors. The W3 examples were all about changing color or size and not
			moving things, but after reading different tutorials online it made sense.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>The columns proved to be a bit problematic. The three columns for the
			challenge, problems, and results sections kept bleeding into each other.
			Forums online said to use tables which, of course, I would not do. What
			ended up working was using breaks in between the sections and adding more
			padding.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>This lab resulted in a lab16 page with columns, animations, and transformations.
			We can now easily add background images and small animations to our pages,
			which add a more professional feel. We are also now confident in using the
			transform: translateX function to center different elements.
