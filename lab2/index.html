	<h1>Lab 2 - Your First html </h1>
	<h2>Hello World!!</h2>
	<p>“Being vulnerable is not about fear, grief, or disappointment,
			 it’s the birthplace of everything we are hungry for.”</p>
	<p1>I believe the things the human heart is hungry for are basic needs: love, belonging, joy, empathy.
			Allowing yourself to feel this way in front of others will open your mind for understanding and your
			heart for comfort. I’m going to share a little bit about myself with you today in hopes that you
			would share your own vulnerabilities with me. I spend a lot of my free time drawing and writing.
			These pastimes are easy for me, mostly because I love the distraction. I have an extremely hard
			time being alone, so when I can sit down with a pencil and paper and get my thoughts or ideas down
			it makes me feel a little less disconnected. As if my ideas are on paper that someone validates them.</p2>
