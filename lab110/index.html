She's wacthing me...I can't take it. I hate those eyes, those fucking lifeless eyes. She's even here now as I type...breathing down my neck...Please if you're reading this, whatever you do, don't look into her eyes...</p>

			<p>Yesterday, upon the stair,</p>
			<p>I met a woman who wasn't there</p>
			<p>she wasn't there again today</p>
			<p>I wish, I wish she'd go away...</p>

			<p>When I came home last night at three</p>
			<p>The woman was waiting there for me</p>
			<p>But when I looked around the hall</p>
			<p>I couldn't see her there at all!</p>
