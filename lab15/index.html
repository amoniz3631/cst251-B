			<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
			<p>The most challenging property we had to implement was making a box-shadow.
			Even after looking at different websites it wasn't quite clear which edge
			each unit correlated to. The Google inspect tool once again came in handy
		 	to figure this out.</p>

			<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
			<p>The problem we keep running into is our nav bars not sticking despite
			having a position of sticky. In order to solve this we tried changing the
			height of the page, the z-index of elements, and the height and width of
			the nav bar itself. None of those solutions worked, but a forum on Free
			Code Camp suggested changing the position to fixed instead which 'fixed' it
			so to speak.</p>

			<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
			<p>This lab resulted in us creating a lab 15 page that helped us to learn
			how to use shadows, gradients, filters, and other new styling properties to
			enhance the look of our pages.</p>
