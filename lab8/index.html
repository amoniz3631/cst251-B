		<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>
		<p>I think the most difficult part of this lab was to figure out how to use the CSS Selectors correctly</p>

		<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
		<p>I had problems lining up my paragraph which was extremely annoying, but I figured it out. </p>

		<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
		<p>I think this lab came out pretty well. I really like Bens lab, I think his structure is really nice.</p>
